- 👋 Hi, I’m @SuperDanTaz
- 👀 I’m interested in Astronomy, Web Design, Cats, Baseball, and Neurology
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development through John Hopkins University
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with new businesses to help them launch a website for them so they will eventually have someone be able to administrate it later.
